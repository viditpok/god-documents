 * current[] is an array of pointers to the currently running processes.
 * There is one array element corresponding to each CPU in the simulation.
 *
 * current[] should be updated by schedule() each time a process is scheduled
 * on a CPU.  Since the current[] array is accessed by multiple threads, you
 * will need to use a mutex to protect it.  current_mutex has been provided
 * for your use.
 *
 * rq is a pointer to a struct you should use for your ready queue
 * implementation. The head of the queue corresponds to the process
 * that is about to be scheduled onto the CPU, and the tail is for
 * convenience in the enqueue function. See student.h for the
 * relevant function and struct declarations.
 *
 * Similar to current[], rq is accessed by multiple threads,
 * so you will need to use a mutex to protect it. ready_mutex has been
 * provided for that purpose.
 *
 * The condition variable queue_not_empty has been provided for you
 * to use in conditional waits and signals.
 *
 * Please look up documentation on how to properly use pthread_mutex_t
 * and pthread_cond_t.
 *
 * A scheduler_algorithm variable and sched_algorithm_t enum have also been
 * supplied to you to keep track of your scheduler's current scheduling
 * algorithm. You should update this variable according to the program's
 * command-line arguments. Read student.h for the definitions of this type.
