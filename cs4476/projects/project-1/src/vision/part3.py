    HINTS:
    - You should use the 2d convolution operator from torch.nn.functional.
    - In PyTorch, d1 is `in_channels`, and d2 is `out_channels`
    - Make sure to pad the image appropriately (it's a parameter to the
      convolution function you should use here!).
    - You can assume the number of groups is equal to the number of input channels.
    - You can assume only square filters for this function.
