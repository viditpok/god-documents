Factor Timing Strategy Using Macroeconomic Regimes and NLP 

Team: Devang Ajmera, Vidit Pokharna, Osho Sharma 

1.⁠ ⁠Motivation 

Factor investing (value, momentum, size) is typically implemented statically, 
but empirical evidence shows factor returns are regime-dependent. We propose 
to dynamically allocate across factors using macroeconomic regimes identified 
via NLP on Federal Reserve statements and economic reports. By combining 
traditional factor models with ML and NLP, we aim to build a strategy that 
times factors more effectively and improves risk-adjusted performance. 

2.⁠ ⁠Research Questions 

•  Can NLP on FOMC minutes and macro reports classify market regimes 

(expansion, slowdown, recession)? 

•  Do factor returns (value, momentum, size) vary systematically across 

these regimes? 

•  Does an ML-driven factor timing strategy improve Sharpe ratios and 

drawdown control vs. static factor allocations? 

3.⁠ ⁠Data 

•  WRDS: CRSP (stock returns), Compustat (fundamentals for value/size), 

Fama-French factors (via WRDS/Ken French) 

•  Public: FOMC minutes (federalreserve.gov), FRED macro series (GDP, 

CPI), economic releases 

•  Optional: Social sentiment (X API) for macro commentary 

4.⁠ ⁠Methodology 

•  NLP Regime Classification: Apply FinBERT or similar to Fed 

minutes/reports to classify regime tone (expansion vs. recession) 

•  Feature Set: Factor returns, macro indicators, NLP-derived regime scores 
•  Modeling: Gradient boosting / random forests to predict next-period 

factor performance 

•  Strategy: Allocate across factors by overweighting stocks with high 

exposure to predicted top-performing factors 

•  Backtest: Weekly rebalancing, realistic costs, benchmarked against buy-

and-hold SPY and equal-weight factor allocation

Fed’s  topics  classification.  The  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  (FOMC) 
statement is the primary tool that the monetary authority uses to communicate its 
monetary policy. It contains the target range for the federal funds rate, transmits 
its  medium-term  perspective  on  the  US  economy,  and  offers  insights  on  the 
outcome of future votes. However, the interpretation of the Fed’s monetary policy 
statement  could  be  subject  to  a  certain  subjectivity  due  to  the  existence  of 
behavioral biases that limit an objective interpretation. 

The  following  research  note  describes  a  natural  language  processing  (NLP)

it also provides a methodology to confirm whether the communication made by 
the Central Bank is consistent with the monetary policy implemented.

NLP and Machine Learning. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has evolved 
to discover common features in verbal and written communication. Quantitative

Text mining is a tool used for extracting a summary from a set of documents. This 
is  commonly  referred  to  as  a  corpus.  Central  bank  communication  usually 
includes  terms  or  phrases  that  convey  significant  messages  related  to  the 
economy’s evolution and can be extracted with the appropriate text mining tools. 
In the sentiment analysis literature, Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods 
are used to build dictionaries that can be associated with sentiments. 

Unstructured data, such as Fed statements, provide a large amount of information. 
Unlike traditional methods of macroeconomic analysis, it is necessary to use NLP 
techniques to extract value from the statements. As a result, the main source of 
information for this study are the Fed’s monetary policy statements from 1978 to 
2022.

The  NLP  model  was  carried  out  using  Python,  since  the  monetary  policy 
statements are available in PDF and HTML formats. In total, 326 Fed statements 
were considered for our model (August 1978 to July 2022). The following figure 
shows the treatment applied to the press releases:

2016 

The  data  engineering implemented  starts-off by downloading  and cleaning the 
text  of the statements.  Then,  NLP techniques  were  applied to  extract  the most 
valuable information contained in the documents. Next, words that didn’t added 
value (stop words), that appeared only once within the corpus (hapaxes), and that 
were  present  in  100% of the  documents  were eliminated.  In addition,  n-grams 
composed of 2 or more tokens (minimum processed text unit) were constructed, 
given that they could have high relevance in the interpretation of the document, 
for  example: 
low  unemployment,  high 
unemployment;  economic  growth,  etc.  Finally,  lemmatization  techniques  were 
used to reduce the words to their common root, to condense the size of the text 
and eliminate the unnecessary noise. As a result, a clean corpus was obtained.

inflation; 

low 

It  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  above-mentioned  cleaning  process  is 
extremely important to build the ML classification model. Prior to the model, a 
bag of words (BoW) was built as the main input for defining a dictionary used 
during the modeling process.

The model was estimated using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). These assume 
that each statement can be represented by a mixture of topics, and each topic is 
described  by  a  bag  of  words  (BoW),  the  following  figure  is  a  general 
representation of the LDA model.

LDA is a generative model that describes how the documents within a dataset 
were  created.  In  this  context,  a  dataset  is  a  collection  of  documents,  and  a 
document is a collection of words. Hence, the generative model describes how 
each document is represented by these words. Initially, it is assumed that there 
are K topic distributions within the set of documents, meaning that each K of the 
K multinomial distributions contains V elements, where V is the number of terms 
in our corpus. 

The classification model identified  the most relevant  topics in the corpus built 
from the Federal Reserve Bank statements (refer to Chart 1). The bubble chart 
shows each of the topics defined in all the monetary policy statements. The size 
of the bubble explains the preponderance of the topic, while the dissimilarity that 
exists  between  the  topics  is  represented  by  the  distance  between  each  of  the 
bubbles; that is, the greater the distance, the greater the dissimilarity between the 
topics.

The bubble chart is a visual tool that helped find the optimal number of topics to 
classify all monetary policy statements. It is important to highlight that the ML 
model was trained through iterative processes that allowed to identify the optimal 
hyperparameters of the model to categorize the latent topics within the corpus. 

To evaluate the efficiency of the model, two intrinsic metrics were used:  

1)  Perplexity allows us to measure how well the model predicts a sample. In 
the NLP context, it tells us the level of uncertainty that the model has by 
assigning probabilities to the text; that is, how much entropy the text has 
(the higher the entropy, the higher the level of uncertainty of the model). 
The closer this measure is to zero (including negative values), the more 
relevant the words are. However, the optimization of this measure does 
not  necessarily  reflect  a  better  interpretation  of  the  topics,  since  it  is 
possible to have high perplexity and a null business sense relation. 

2) Coherence. This metric helps us measure  the degree of similarity in the 
semantics of the most relevant words within the topics. There are different 
coherence  measures.  In  this  case  we  use  the  “C_v”  measure,  based  on 
subarrays,  segmentation  of  top  words,  cosine  distances  and  the  use  of 
NMPI (Normalized Mutual Point Information). The higher coherence, the 
more similar the semantics. 

4 

 
 
 
 
The optimal scenario is low perplexity combined with high coherence. However, 
a higher level of coherence is more relevant than low perplexity. In the search for 
the highest coherence, we use a variant of the LDA application, the “LDAMallet” 
model. The latter uses Gibbs sampling, unlike the standard LDA model which 
uses variational Bayesian methods. It is important to emphasize that both models 
require a priori the number of topics in which they will classify our corpus. 

The elbow method was used to establish the optimal number of topics. An interval 
between  10  and  30  topics  was  established  to  measure  the  performance  of  the 
LDAMallet model to analyze their respective coherence. The method showed that 
the optimal scenario were 25 topics, with an approximate coherence of 0.43. The 
standard  LDA  model  with  the  same  scenario  obtained  a  0.39  coherence. 
Consequently, the LDAMallet model was chosen for the classification. 

The LDAMallet model classified each monetary policy statement within the 25 
topics. For this classification, the model establishes the weight that each topic has 
and  assigns  the  one  with  the  greatest  magnitude.  Even  though  25  topics  were 
identified in the corpus, the allocation resulted in 23 relevant topics.  

Subsequently,  the  relationship  between  the  Fed  funds  rate  and  the  semantic 
classification  obtained  was  analyzed  (refer  to  Chart  2).  The  most  important 
finding was the degree of strength, given that the model can explain 9 out of 
10  rate  movements.  The  model  also  defines  the  range  of  variation  of  the 
terminal reference rate (refer to Chart 3). 

The model suggests a terminal rate between 3.5 and 4.25% (upper range). 
After today’s monetary policy announcement, the model classified this statement 
with a topic that anticipates the terminal rate between 3.5% and 4.25% The model 
also confirms the Fed’s congruence in its communication.

Abstract

This article explores dynamic factor allocation by analyzing the cyclical performance of fac-
tors through regime analysis. The authors focus on a U.S. equity investment universe comprising
seven long-only indices representing the market and six style factors: value, size, momentum,
quality, low volatility, and growth. Their approach integrates factor-specific regime inferences of
each factor index’s active performance relative to the market into the Black-Litterman model to
construct a fully-invested, long-only multi-factor portfolio. First, the authors apply the sparse
jump model (SJM) to identify bull and bear market regimes for individual factors, using a feature
set based on risk and return measures from historical factor active returns, as well as variables re-
flecting the broader market environment. The regimes identified by the SJM exhibit enhanced
stability and interpretability compared to traditional methods. A hypothetical single-factor
long-short strategy is then used to assess these regime inferences and fine-tune hyperparame-
ters, resulting in a positive Sharpe ratio of this strategy across all factors with low correlation
among them. These regime inferences are then incorporated into the Black-Litterman frame-
work to dynamically adjust allocations among the seven indices, with an equally weighted (EW)
portfolio serving as the benchmark. Empirical results show that the constructed multi-factor
portfolio significantly improves the information ratio (IR) relative to the market, raising it from
just 0.05 for the EW benchmark to approximately 0.4. When measured relative to the EW
benchmark itself, the dynamic allocation achieves an IR of around 0.4 to 0.5. The strategy
also enhances absolute portfolio performance across key metrics such as the Sharpe ratio and
maximum drawdown. These findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging regime-switching
signals to enhance factor allocation by capitalizing on factor cyclicality.

Introduction

Originating from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Sharpe, 1964), which identifies the
market as the sole source of risk that earns a premium, factors have gained significant attention
as key drivers of the cross-sectional variation in security returns, offering a systematic approach
to harvesting additional risk premia. Research on factors has expanded beyond common stocks to
encompass other assets, such as credit (De Jong and Fabozzi, 2020) and real estate (Reid et al.,
2023), and even emerging assets like cryptocurrency (Liu et al., 2022). Factor investing has redefined
the traditional approach to asset allocation, shifting the focus from asset classes to factors, in an
effort to achieve diversification benefits more effectively (Bass et al., 2017). With the development
of indexing and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), access to style factors such as value and momentum
has extended from actively managed funds to index-tracking smart beta ETFs. These rule-based
“passive” ETFs enable investors to express their active views in a cost-efficient manner (Buetow
and Hanke, 2024).

Although many well-known factors have been empirically shown to deliver excess returns over
prolonged periods, often spanning decades,1 factor performance over shorter horizons is subject
to strong cyclicality, with periods of persistent underperformance that can last for years. This
cyclicality has been recognized by practitioners as early as the 1990s,2 and more recently by the
significant drawdown experienced in value investing over the past decade (Israel et al., 2021).
In response, numerous factor timing models have been proposed to predict factor premia (Hodges
et al., 2017; DiCiurcio et al., 2024; Vincenz and Zeissler, 2024), utilizing variables such as valuation,
sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators. However, the challenge of accurately forecasting factor
premia has been acknowledged by practitioners (Bender et al., 2018), with some referring to it
as the “siren song” of these timing efforts (Asness, 2016). Nonetheless, there is a consensus that
dynamic factor allocation, informed by time-varying market conditions, has the potential to enhance
portfolio performance compared to a static allocation strategy.

In this article, we explore the opportunities presented by factor cyclicality through the lens of
regime analysis. The phenomenon of regime switching has been observed across nearly all asset
classes and has gained popularity primarily due to its interpretability: the regimes identified by
quantitative models often correspond to real-world events, such as changes in central bank monetary
policies (Sims and Zha, 2006). A financial regime is defined by extended and consecutive periods
characterized by relatively homogeneous market behavior, while a regime shift signals an abrupt
but persistent change in that behavior. This framework aligns well with the observed alternation
between periods of persistent under- and outperformance in factors. Additionally, understanding
factor performance through regimes is supported by the business cycle – a key predictor of factor
premia, as demonstrated in Hodges et al. (2017); Polk et al. (2020) – which originally motivated
the development of financial regime-switching models (Hamilton, 1989). Previous studies, including
Guidolin and Timmermann (2008); Ang (2023), have employed Markov-switching models to perform
regime analysis on factor performance, providing valuable insights into the time-varying nature of
factor returns.

It is important to clearly distinguish between factor regime analysis and factor timing. The key

1For example, the seminal work by Fama and French (1992) demonstrates the return differences in portfolios
formed by sorting based on firm size and book-to-market ratio over an approximately 30-year period from 1963 to
1990.

2For example, in a 1992 article (Sharpe, 1992), which proposes analyzing equity fund performance based on the
value and size factors, William F. Sharpe commented: “those concerned with these distinctions (in asset character-
istics) have focused . . . on long-run average return differences . . . Less attention has been paid to likely sources of
short-run variability in returns among such groups.”

difference lies in the interpretative nature of regime analysis as an unsupervised algorithm, con-
trasting with the predictive nature of timing strategies. While a timing strategy directly attempts
to link features known at the end of each period to future factor performance, a regime identifica-
tion model classifies all historical periods into homogeneous sub-clusters during the training phase,
based on characteristics observed at the end of each period. No supervision in forecasting future
returns is involved. Following this in-sample learning process, an online inference algorithm – cou-
pled with the core assumption of persistence – is employed in real-time application. The goal is
that the identified regime at the end of each period will persist in the near future without frequent
shifts. As Nystrup et al. (2015) summarize, the purpose of regime-based strategies is “not to predict
regime shifts or future market movements, but to identify when a regime shift has occurred, and
then benefit from the persistence of equilibrium returns and volatilities.”

Our study focuses on the allocation among seven assets: one U.S. market index (serving as a
benchmark for the overall equity market) and six long-only U.S. equity smart beta indices repre-
senting the style factors of: value, size, momentum, quality, low volatility, and growth. We aim to
maintain a long-only, fully-invested allocation across these seven indices which dynamically adjusts
to the identified regimes of factor performance. This asset universe ensures practicality and ease
of implementation, as all indices are accessible through ETFs with relatively low expense ratios.
Additionally, we incorporate realistic constraints, including transaction costs and a one-day delay
in applying the online regime inference.

Our methodology involves conducting regime analysis based on the daily active returns for each
of the six factor indices, followed by synthesizing these factor-specific regime inferences using the
Black-Litterman framework to incorporate our relative views on each factor’s performance. For the
regime identification model, we highlight the statistical jump model (JM), which clusters temporal
features while imposing a penalty for each transition in the hidden state sequence. This explicit
jump penalization allows JMs to moderate the frequency of regime shifts, enhancing stability and
robustness against significant noise in market data. Specifically, we implement the sparse jump
model (SJM) (Nystrup et al., 2021), which introduces a layer of feature weighting and selection on
top of the JM based on each feature’s in-sample clustering effect. This extension further improves
the applicability of JM in high-dimensional scenarios, where both informative and irrelevant features
are present. Compared to traditional Markov-switching models, recent studies (Nystrup et al.,
2020b,a; Aydınhan et al., 2024; Shu et al., 2024a) have demonstrated that JMs achieve higher
statistical accuracy and offer better downside risk management.

We input around twenty features into a two-state sparse jump model for each factor index.
These features include those computed from historical daily factor active returns, as well as others
related to the market environment, all of which are relatively easy to retrieve in real time. The
two identified regimes are distinguished by returns, naturally interpreted as bull or bear factor
performance. For each factor, we apply the regimes inferred in an online fashion to construct a
hypothetical long-short strategy that, in essence, involves going long on the factor during anticipated
bull markets and shorting the factor otherwise. This single-factor long-short strategy mimics the
active positions in the Black-Litterman model when a relative view of the active return for a specific
factor is inputted. Therefore, its performance serves as a financial evaluation of the quality of the
regime inference and is used for tuning the hyperparameters in the SJM. We achieve a positive
Sharpe ratio for the long-short strategy across all factors, with relatively low correlations among
them, enabling effective synthesis through the Black-Litterman model.

We adopt the Black-Litterman model in the final stage of portfolio construction due to its
practical relevance in portfolio management. An equally weighted (EW) portfolio among the seven
indices, rebalanced quarterly, serves as the benchmark. Since our regime analysis focuses on each
factor’s active performance relative to the market, the natural choice for view portfolios is six

3

relative portfolios that go long on the factor and short on the market. We link the inferred regimes
to the expected returns of these view portfolios by calculating the historical average active return
across all training periods under the inferred regime. The posterior expected returns are then
input into a standard mean-variance optimization with long-only and fully-invested constraints to
determine the optimal allocation. The confidence level of the views is adjusted to achieve a specified
tracking error.

In terms of active3 performance, our dynamic allocation strategy significantly improves both
the information ratio and max drawdown relative to the market, and achieves an information ratio
of approximately 0.4 to 0.5 relative to the EW benchmark. For absolute performance, our strategy
consistently enhances (risk-adjusted) return metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio, as well as risk met-
rics including volatility and max drawdown, all within a reasonable turnover rate. These results
highlight the benefits of dynamically adjusting factor allocations based on identifying persistent
regimes in factor performance.

The outline of the article is as follows. We begin with an overview of the factor data used in our
analysis in Section 2. The following two sections describe our methodology and empirical results for
regime identification and online inference, and the portfolio construction via the Black-Litterman
model in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. We conclude with our main findings in the final section.

2 Asset Universe: Factor Index Data

The study of optimal allocation among a collection of factors dates back to the early 2000s
when ˇLuboˇs P´astor (2000); Brennan and Xia (2001) explored how an investor could exploit mar-
ket anomalies representing the mispricing of an asset pricing model (e.g., value and size effects are
anomalies with respect to the CAPM). Their investment universe typically consisted of a broad mar-
ket index and several long-short factor portfolios, such as the SMB and HML portfolios constructed
by Fama and French (1993). Despite the widespread popularity of these long-short portfolios within
academia – particularly those formed by sorting based on stock characteristics – they remain far
from practical investment opportunities, as they are constructed “without features or constraints
that would make them investable in practice (e.g., limits on position size)” (Bender et al., 2013),
especially for momentum, which inherently involves considerable turnover.

To ensure realism in our study, we adopt an investment universe of seven long-only U.S. equity
indices, reflecting the market and six style factors: value, size, momentum, quality, low volatility,
and growth. The six factor indices represent long-only portfolios with tilts toward specific stock
characteristics. All seven indices are tracked by actively traded ETFs with assets under management
(AUM) in the billions of dollars and are accessible at relatively low expense ratios.4 We sourced
daily total returns for these indices from Bloomberg, covering the period from 1993 to mid-2024.5
The six smart beta indices deviate from market capitalization weighting in their parent index by
assigning higher weights to stocks exhibiting targeted characteristics, such as momentum, measured
by past stock returns within a specified historical window. For many of these indices, an initial
screening is conducted so that only a small portion of the stocks – usually well under half of all
stocks in the parent index – with the most pronounced targeted characteristics receive non-zero

3Throughout the article, “active” refers to returns relative to a benchmark, either the market or the EW portfolio
(as described in the previous paragraph). In contrast, “absolute” refers to returns in excess of the risk-free rate,
which is the U.S. Treasury 3-month constant maturity yield.

4For example, the iShares MSCI factor ETFs have an expense ratio of 15 basis points, comparable to many popular
cap-weighted ETFs, such as those tracking the Nasdaq-100 or the Nasdaq Composite Index, which have an expense
ratio of around 20 basis points.

allocations. This approach results in a stock universe that is quite different from a truly passive
cap-weighted index. Bender et al. (2014) provide a more detailed treatment of these smart beta
indices, arguing that they account for more than 80% of the alphas of all active managers.

Despite the long-only index construction, we assess factor performance on a relative basis by
computing factor active returns, defined as the factor index return minus the market index return.6
This relative perspective aligns with the original discovery of factors as the outperformance of
one group of stocks versus another, and also helps reduce correlation when performing regime
analysis on individual factors. Although factor indices involve weight tilts and stock screening,
they still maintain a considerable long-run beta to the market, typically ranging from 0.75 to 1.1
(see Exhibit 1), resulting in a high correlation among absolute factor returns.7 This reduction in
correlation is evident from the cumulative active and absolute return curves for all factor indices
shown in Exhibit 2. By removing the common market component, we reveal distinct patterns for
various factors, contrasting with the highly correlated growth trends seen in the absolute return
curves.
It is worth noting that although we assess factor performance on a relative basis, the
final multi-factor portfolio remains a long-only allocation across the seven indices, with no shorting
allowed, to ensure practicality.

In the active performance table for all factors presented in Exhibit 1, we observe positive active
returns for all factors except low volatility, which is attributed to its inherently low beta. After
adjusting for market risk, all factors display a positive alpha intercept, reflecting their design to
achieve positive risk premia, although most of these are not statistically significant.

Exhibit 2 further highlights the increased difficulty of performing regime analysis based on active
factor performance compared to absolute performance, as analyzed in Bosancic et al. (2024). This
challenge arises from the lack of a strong trend in active returns, in contrast to the clear upward
and downward trends observed in absolute return curves. Indeed, factor active returns are only a
few percentage points per annum, compared to the approximately 8–10% expected from a market
index. Moreover, the sharp drawdowns experienced by a fully invested index during major market
crashes – such as the dot-com bubble and the global financial crisis (GFC), whose accurate detection
has been shown by Mulvey and Liu (2016); Shu et al. (2024a) to be effective in mitigating downside
risk – are not prevalent in the active return plots.8 While most previous regime-based strategies,
such as those in Bulla et al. (2011); Nystrup et al. (2015, 2018), focus on identifying the regimes
of a long-only equity index to enhance asset allocation performance, in this article, we extend this
approach by demonstrating the use of regime-switching signals based on active performance.

Regarding factor correlations, as discussed in Bender and Wang (2016), a “bottom-up” ap-
proach, which constructs a multi-factor portfolio at the security level by incorporating all factor
characteristics simultaneously, offers greater potential to exploit interaction effects among factors

6Our use of active returns follows the approach in Hodges et al. (2017). Alternatively, employing residual returns
that account for betas could potentially address the inherent low-beta effect in the low volatility factor index, as
discussed later, and can also be easily integrated into the Black-Litterman model.

7Our data reveals that the highest correlation of factor active returns is 54% between value and size, and −52%
between value and growth; however, all correlations between factor returns in excess of the risk-free rate exceed 85%.
These figures are consistent with those reported in Hodges et al. (2017); Polk et al. (2020); DiCiurcio et al. (2024).
Although the last article in this list does not explicitly work with active returns, it attempts to forecast the winning
factor, which still operates on a comparative rather than absolute basis.

8This is evidenced by both the magnitude and duration of the max drawdown (MDD) seen in Exhibits 1 and 2.
While a market index often experiences an MDD of more than −50% within one to two years, factor active returns
typically undergo an MDD of approximately −40% over a much longer period. For example, value’s MDD relative
to the market began at the start of 2015 and has persisted until recently, lasting nearly a decade. Even momentum,
known for “momentum crashes” (Daniel and Moskowitz, 2016), experienced its relative MDD between February 2021
and July 2023, spanning over two years. Its post-GFC crash lasted around a year and a half, from mid-2008 to the
end of 2009, comparable to the market, albeit with a much milder magnitude of −27.5%.

pre-constructed factor portfolios. The bottom-up approach is sometimes preferred by asset man-
agers and ETF providers. However, our allocation approach is inherently easier to implement and
is more accessible to investors who lack the resources to perform nuanced stock-level analysis.

3 Regime Identification and Online Inference

3.1 Statistical Jump Models

Our study employs the sparse version of the recently developed statistical jump model (JM) as
the regime identification model. While machine learning clustering algorithms – such as the k-means
clustering used to detect market risk regimes (DiCiurcio et al., 2024) – have gained popularity in
financial applications, JMs are particularly well-suited to time series data due to their incorporation
of temporal information through an explicit jump penalty for each transition in the hidden state
sequence. This approach acknowledges the inherent persistence in financial regimes and enhances
the interpretability of the identified regimes, as market participants typically do not expect frequent
regime shifts. Bosancic et al. (2024) recently demonstrated the successful application of JMs in
conducting regime analysis for long-only factor portfolios.

Given a series of high-dimensional standardized features x0, . . . , xT −1 (detailed in the next

subsection), we estimate a two-state JM (K = 2) by solving the following optimization problem:

min
θ0,...,θK−1,s0,...,sT −1

t=0

2

∥xt − θst∥2

2 + λ

T −1
(cid:88)

t=1

1{st−1̸=st} .

(1)

Here, the optimization variables include the unobserved state sequence s0, . . . , sT −1, which assigns
each period to one of the K states, and K centroids θ0, . . . , θK−1, representing each state. The
dissimilarity between the feature vector xt and its assigned centroid θst is quantified by the squared
ℓ2-distance. From the optimal state sequence, we derive the transition probability matrix and
calculate metrics such as return and volatility for each state.9 The JM’s objective function balances
the partitioning of all training periods into homogeneous sub-clusters with prior beliefs about the
frequency of regime shifts. The jump penalty λ ≥ 0 moderates the fixed-cost regularization term
incurred whenever there is a jump between consecutive state variables (i.e., when st−1 ̸= st). This
penalty controls the persistence level of the state sequence and is tuned as a hyperparameter,
often via cross-validation. With a zero jump penalty, the model reduces to a k-means clustering
algorithm, ignoring temporal information; as λ increases, state transitions become less frequent,
potentially grouping all data points into a single cluster if λ is set high enough.

To further enhance the JM, we implement the sparse jump model (SJM) (Nystrup et al., 2021),
which adds a layer of feature weighting based on each feature’s clustering effect, measured by the
reduction in variance along its dimension. Features that lead to greater variance reduction are as-
signed higher weights, while an ℓ1-norm constraint on the weight vector ensures that uninformative
features with poor clustering effects receive a weight of zero and are excluded from consideration.
The upper bound κ on the ℓ1-norm serves as an additional hyperparameter, controlling the number
of features included. The SJM estimation alternates between fitting the JM using weighted features
and recalculating the feature weights based on the current JM fit until convergence is reached. This
extension addresses the original JM’s limitation of assigning equal weights to all features, improving

9An implementation of a collection of jump models is available on the first author’s GitHub page (https://github.
com/Yizhan-Oliver-Shu/jump-models). For a detailed explanation of the coordinate descent algorithm used to solve
the optimization problem, see Nystrup et al. (2020b).

its ability to extract useful information from high-dimensional feature sets, which are increasingly
common in modern financial data.

The suite of JMs offers several advantages over traditional Markov-switching models, such as
hidden Markov models (HMMs), in financial applications. Their primary strength lies in enhanced
robustness and stability, achieved through explicit jump penalization and a likelihood-free approach.
Recent studies, including Nystrup et al. (2020b,a); Aydınhan et al. (2024), highlight the suscepti-
bility of HMMs to mis-estimation due to issues like imbalanced clusters (e.g., the small proportion
of bear markets) and insufficient data, as well as the mis-specification of likelihood functions. These
studies, through stylized simulations and real-data tests, demonstrate the improved statistical ac-
curacy of JMs and their continuous version over HMMs. Shu et al. (2024a) further show that this
improved accuracy can translate into better investment strategy performance. Additionally, JMs
naturally accommodate high-dimensional feature sets, unlike HMMs, which are typically applied
to single-dimensional return series. Nystrup et al. (2021) highlight the advantages of SJMs over
high-dimensional Markov-switching models, while Bosancic et al. (2024) demonstrate the flexibility
of JMs in accommodating regime-dependent features.

3.1.1 Features

Exhibit 3 provides a detailed description of all features inputted into the SJM, categorized into
two types: factor-specific features derived from historical factor active returns and general market-
environment features. For the first type, when performing regime analysis on each individual factor,
we calculate a collection of risk and return measures based on the past active returns of that factor.
The return measures include the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) active return,
along with three technical indicators – relative strength index (RSI), stochastic oscillator %K,
and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) – all computed over three window lengths
corresponding to 1.5 weeks, one month, and three months. These return features aim to capture
the time-series momentum effect substantiated in Gupta and Kelly (2019) for factor returns, and
have been applied in various timing models such as those in Zakamulin (2014); Hodges et al. (2017).
Their application in identifying regimes in cryptocurrency markets via SJMs is demonstrated in
Cortese et al. (2023). For risk measures, we compute downside deviation, focusing on negative
active returns, and active market beta, both using an exponentially weighted calculation with a
medium window length. It is important to note that these features are based on past returns and
thus lag the regime shift identified ex-post. It is worth reiterating that regime analysis does not aim
to predict regime shifts but rather to benefit from accurately identifying when they have occurred,
allowing for allocation adjustments and gaining an advantage over sticking to a static strategy.

The second type of features focuses on the general market environment, measuring market
returns, the VIX index, the 2-year Treasury constant maturity yield as an interest rate gauge, and
the yield curve slope measured by the difference between the 10-year and 2-year yields. Appropriate
transformations, such as log-differences and exponential smoothing, are applied to these features.
The market environment naturally plays a critical role in driving factor performance. Specifically,
Hodges et al. (2017) found that the business cycle is a highly effective predictor of factor premia,
with a stylized pattern where economic slowdowns favor defensive strategies like quality and low
volatility, while value, with its higher financial leverage, tends to plunge – this pattern reverses
during periods of economic expansion. We use the aforementioned variables, easily sourced from
the FRED Database, as proxies for the general market environment. These variables are based on
trading markets, updated daily, and are readily accessible in real time without delay.

VIX index, where positive/negative values indicate an increasing/decreasing volatility environment. Raw data for
the last three market-environment features are sourced from the FRED Database.

Exhibit 3: Overview of Features Inputted into the Sparse Jump Model

3.1.2 An Example of SJM Fitting

To better illustrate the mechanism of SJMs and facilitate comparison with baseline models,
we present an example fitting on the value factor over a recent 12-year training window, spanning
from June 2012 to June 2024. Exhibit 4 displays the in-sample fitted regimes from three models:
SJMs, HMMs, and k-means clustering, while Exhibit 5 shows the feature weights and corresponding
optimal centroid values under the two market states for each feature dimension in the SJM fitting.
We distinguish between bull and bear market states based on the cumulative active return for each
state across all training periods. The SJM and k-means clustering are estimated using the features
described in Exhibit 3, with the SJM hyperparameters set to typical values,10 while the HMM is
fitted using daily active returns as input.

From the figures, we observe that the SJM accurately captures the persistent periods of out-
and underperformance of the value factor, including the rebound after the GFC, the recent plunge
following the COVID-19 market crash, and the high-interest-rate environment from 2023. A few
rebounds between these bear markets are also identified. This level of persistence contrasts sharply
with k-means clustering, which does not account for temporal consistency and results in an unre-
alistically large number of regime shifts. The SJM can be seen as an effective smoothing of the
k-means fitting, enhanced by the feature weighting procedure. As for HMMs, the balanced nature
of bull and bear markets in factor performance makes the issue of lacking persistence less pro-
nounced than in applications to market indices, as illustrated, for example, in Figure 6 of Shu et al.
(2024a). Nonetheless, a few short-lived regime shifts are still present, and if these are overlooked,

10In our empirical study, the SJM hyperparameters are tuned using a time series cross-validation approach to

ensure practicality, as detailed in the following subsection.

models use factor active returns as input. The SJM is configured with typical hyperparameters: λ = 50.0 and

Notes: See Exhibit 3 for a detailed description of all features. The SJM is configured with typical hyperparameters
λ = 50.0 and κ2 = 9.5. For the downside deviation (DD) feature, the average of the original DD values (multiplied
by
2 to align with the volatility computation) within each state is displayed, although the logarithm of the DD
value is used as an input feature in the SJM. All values are annualized where applicable.

Exhibit 5: Feature Weights and Optimal Centroid Values Under Bull and Bear Market Regimes
for the Sparse Jump Model Fitting for the Value Factor, June 2012 – June 2024

the model primarily indicates a bull market before 2019 and a bear market afterward, neglecting
much of the market dynamics and potential opportunities.

In terms of feature weights, Exhibit 5 shows that the factor-specific return features with the
longest window sizes receive the highest weights. The quarterly horizon aligns with the timeframe
market participants typically use to assess factor performance. The four market-environment fea-
tures receive very little weight, which may underestimate the influence of the market environment
on factor performance. Exploring more informative market features could potentially enhance the
performance of the SJM.

Regarding optimal centroids, these values align well with expectations: in bull markets identified
for the value factor, return features exceed baseline values, with positive EWMA active returns,
RSI and %K values above 50, and positive MACD – all indicating strong price momentum – and
a lower risk measure of downside deviation. The opposite is true for bear markets. The differences
between the centroid values under the two states are also quite discernible.

3.1.3 Online Inference

All previous exposition focuses on the in-sample training of SJMs, where the estimated hidden
state sequence s0, . . . , sT −1 is derived using all market data up to the end of period T − 1. However,
for real-time applications, we must infer the state st based solely on data available at the end of the
current period, without relying on future information. This distinction is commonly referred to as
smoothing and filtering in signal processing: smoothing uses both past and future data points to

11

estimate values, while filtering relies only on current and past data, making it suitable for real-time
applications.

In the case of JMs, after estimating the optimal centroids and state sequence during the training
phase, we must make real-time inferences when a new feature vector xT becomes available at the
end of day T . For investment purposes, following the approach of Nystrup et al. (2015, 2018),
we assume that this inferred regime sT can only be applied on day T + 2 with a one-day delay –
meaning that we estimate sT at the end of day T and rebalance the portfolio accordingly at the
end of the next day, T + 1. This method of applying online inferred regimes to adjust allocations
relies heavily on the assumption of regime persistence, whereby the regime identified for period T
is expected to persist in the near future. Consequently, this approach places a high demand on the
stability of the inferred regime sequence. Admittedly, a rapidly flipping regime-switching signal
(e.g., the regimes identified in Exhibit 4 for k-means clustering) is unlikely to remain effective given
the time discrepancy between T and T + 2.

A basic k-means-style online inference involves directly assigning the feature vector xT to the
nearest centroid, ignoring temporal information. To enhance regime persistence, we employ the
online inference algorithm outlined in Nystrup et al. (2020a), which efficiently incorporates historical
data. The core idea is to solve the optimization problem (1) in JMs over the state sequence within
a lookback window, while keeping the centroids fixed at their previously estimated values, and then
extract the last optimal state as the online inference. This online algorithm performs the task for
a sequence of consecutive inferences in linear time.

Despite this improvement in persistence, it is important to note that the number of regime
shifts in real-time inference remains higher – usually twice as frequent – than in the in-sample
training. This discrepancy arises because both the first and last few states in a window suffer from
the highest estimation error, as shown in Figure 1 of Bulla et al. (2011), due to the lack of past or
future data context. By analogy, pinpointing the exact onset of a bear market shift (as identified
in hindsight) in real-time is challenging; both individuals and quantitative models typically require
several consecutive weeks of negative returns to confirm the shift.

An alternative approach to utilizing JMs for generating regime forecasts is to train a separate
algorithm that predicts the in-sample identified regime labels st using another feature vector ˜xt−1,
which is strictly available beforehand, as illustrated in Shu et al. (2024b).

3.2 Single-Factor Long-Short Strategy

The previous discussion on training the SJM and executing online inference assumes a fixed set
of hyperparameters. To optimize these parameters, we evaluate the quality of the online inferred
regimes by constructing a hypothetical long-short strategy, where we generally go long on the factor
during anticipated bull markets and short during bear markets. Cortese et al. (2024) proposes an
alternative method for model selection in JMs using generalized information criteria (GIC).

The construction of this factor-specific long-short strategy closely relates to the active weights
derived from a relative view on the active return for a specific factor in the Black-Litterman model,
while neglecting the influence of other views (details in Appendix B). To implement this strategy,
we first associate the inferred regimes for a specific factor with the historical average active return
across all training periods under the same regime. This historical average serves as the expected
active return for the factor, which also functions as the expected return for the relative view portfolio
in the Black-Litterman model. It is not intended to be an accurate active return forecast but rather
a convenient way to represent the inferred regimes without explicit human interpretation.11

11There are situations where both regimes display positive average returns, so the expectation of a clear bull/bear

regime distinction may not hold.

Notes: The return of this single-factor long-short strategy generally equals the factor’s active return during bull
regimes and its negative active return during bear regimes, before accounting for transaction costs. This hypothetical
strategy is intended solely for evaluating the online inferred regimes and not for practical trading. “#(Shifts)” stands
for the number of regime shifts per year. A transaction cost of 5 basis points is applied for both buying and selling.
All values are annualized where applicable.

Exhibit 6: Performance of the Hypothetical Single-Factor Long-Short Strategy and Correlation of
Strategy Returns Among Factors Over the Test Period of 2007–2024

When the expected return exceeds 5% per annum, the strategy invests 100% in a relative
portfolio by going long 100% on the factor and shorting 100% of the market. Conversely, when the
expected return falls below −5%, the strategy shorts the factor 100% and longs the market 100%.
If the expected returns fall within the range of −5% to 5%, we invest in this relative portfolio
using a linear weighting. Thus, this strategy invests in a relative portfolio reflecting the factor’s
active returns, with the position size proportional to the expected factor active return, capped at
±5%. For performance evaluation, a transaction cost of 5 basis points for both buying and selling
is consistently applied. A radical regime shift from fully bullish to bearish would involve a one-way
200% turnover (100% to −100% for the factor and the opposite for the market position).

The Sharpe ratio of this factor-specific long-short strategy serves as the financial evaluation
of the online inferred regimes, and we adjust the SJM hyperparameters accordingly using a time-
series cross-validation approach. To avoid optimizing over a large grid, we tune the hyperparameters
for each factor individually. Our expanding training window spans a minimum of 8 years and a
maximum of 12 years. For each set of hyperparameters, we refit the SJM monthly and perform
online inference during the intervals between refittings. The validation window spans 6 years and
rolls forward every six months, during which we select the hyperparameter combination that yields
the highest Sharpe ratio for the long-short strategy, applying these values for the next six months.
Our testing period begins in 2007. It is worth noting that this single-factor long-short strategy is
intended solely for evaluating the inferred regimes and not for practical trading, which is why we
call it “hypothetical.” The final multi-factor portfolio involves a long-only allocation among the
seven indices.

The Sharpe ratios of these strategies range from a low of 0.16 for momentum to a high of
nearly 0.4 for value and growth. The varied Sharpe ratios reflect the differing levels of difficulty
in accurately discerning bull and bear markets across factors. The frequency of regime shifts per
year also varies. All Sharpe ratios are positive, demonstrating the potential utility of our regime-
switching signal. The correlations among the factor-specific long-short strategies are generally low,
below 0.5, suggesting potential for synthesis using the Black-Litterman model, which can effectively
combine these factor-specific regime inferences while accounting for risk and portfolio constraints.
Exhibit 7 displays the online inferred regimes after hyperparameter tuning using SJMs for the
six factors, alongside their cumulative factor active returns. These results complement the in-sample
fitted regimes for the value factor under a specific hyperparameter setting, as shown in Exhibit 4.
Overall, for most factors, the identified bear markets align with significant price declines, during
which reducing market exposure helps avoid losses and mitigate risk. For factors where the long-
short strategy achieves a higher Sharpe ratio, the identified regimes appear to be more accurate.
During periods of market oscillation, the SJM produces rapidly flipping regimes, indicating its
sensitivity to price reversals. For the quality factor, which has particularly low volatility and max
drawdown due to its defensive nature, we found the regime identification to be the least effective.

4 Multi-Factor Portfolio Construction

The final stage integrates all factor-specific regime inferences into a multi-factor portfolio. Here,
the Black-Litterman model plays a central role in expressing our relative views on factor active per-
formance into a long-only and 100% fully invested allocation among the seven indices representing
the market and six style factors. We emphasize our “combination” approach, which invests directly
in pre-constructed factor indices. Alternatively, Kolm and Ritter (2021) offer a framework for in-
corporating factor views into the Black-Litterman model to construct a “bottom-up” multi-factor
portfolio from the security level.

Several alternative methods exist for synthesizing asset-specific regime inferences/forecasts.
Though not explored here, a straightforward approach would be to employ any of the six con-
structed hypothetical long-short factor strategies individually or in combination (e.g., through
equal weighting, as in Bosancic et al. (2024)) as an overlay to an existing allocation to enhance
returns. Alternatively, Shu et al. (2024b) investigate the use of traditional portfolio models, such as
mean-variance and minimum-variance optimization, to synthesize asset-specific regime inferences
into a dynamic allocation among asset classes.

The Black-Litterman model (see Kolm et al. (2021) for an overview) is highly relevant in the
active management industry due to its emphasis on a benchmark portfolio. In our case, we use an
equally weighted (EW) allocation among the seven indices, rebalanced quarterly,12 as the bench-
mark. The robustness of this EW allocation as a benchmark in factor allocation contexts has been
validated by Khang et al. (2023). For prior expected returns, we use a risk aversion parameter of
δ = 2.5, representing the “world average risk tolerance” (He and Litterman, 1999), and estimate
the covariance matrix using an exponentially weighted moving approach with a halflife of 126 days.
In constructing our view portfolios, we naturally express views on factor active returns through
six relative portfolios, each comprising a 100% long position on a factor and a 100% short posi-
tion on the market. The expected factor active return discussed in the previous section is used
as the expected return for these view portfolios. Under a specific confidence level,13 we compute

12This rebalancing frequency aligns with that typically used by ETFs and mutual funds adopting EW strategies.
13Using the same notation as in Appendix B, the diagonal elements of the matrix Ω/τ are chosen as a constant

multiple of the diagonal elements of P ΣP T. The inverse of this constant reflects the confidence level.

Notes: Our dynamic strategy maintains a long-only, fully-invested allocation among the market and six factor indices.

error relative to the EW benchmark. A transaction cost of 5 basis points is applied for both buying and selling. All
values are annualized where applicable.

the posterior expected returns, which are then integrated into a standard mean-variance quadratic
optimization with long-only and fully invested weight constraints to determine the optimal alloca-
tion. Confidence levels are chosen to achieve a targeted tracking error relative to the benchmark,
ranging from 1–4%, allowing us to evaluate the performance of our dynamic allocation strategy.

Exhibit 8 presents the active performance of our dynamic multi-factor portfolio, measured
relative to both the market and the benchmark EW portfolio, over the test period from 2007 to
2024. A transaction cost of 5 basis points is applied for both buying and selling throughout the
performance evaluation. In Panel A, all performance measures are shown relative to the market,
with the EW benchmark exhibiting a negligible positive active return and information ratio (IR).
Our dynamic allocation significantly improves both active return and IR, with the IR increasing
from 0.05 to a maximum of 0.44. Additionally, the maximum drawdown relative to the market is
reduced from −10% to a low of −6%. In Panel B, when evaluating performance relative to the EW
benchmark, our dynamic allocation achieves an IR of approximately 0.4 to 0.5, indicating robust
outperformance over the EW benchmark.

Exhibit 9 presents our strategy’s performance from an absolute perspective (i.e., in excess of
the risk-free rate). The table shows that as the dynamic factor allocation allows for higher tracking
error, both excess returns and the Sharpe ratio improve almost monotonically, while risk measures
such as maximum drawdown decrease, albeit at the cost of higher turnover. An annualized one-
way turnover of around 500% remains within an acceptable range for active management and is
reasonably implementable. One reason the max drawdown is not extensively mitigated, as seen
in Shu et al. (2024a,b); Bosancic et al. (2024), is that we maintain a 100% leverage, whereas
those studies reduce leverage during identified bear markets to avoid significant wealth losses.
Incorporating an additional absolute view on the overall market’s bull/bear regime, as developed in
those studies, into our Black-Litterman model here could potentially achieve further risk mitigation.

Exhibit 9: Absolute Performance Analysis for Strategies Over the Test Period of 2007–2024

In the accompanying figure, we plot the cumulative excess return curves for the market, the
EW benchmark portfolio, and our dynamic allocation with a moderate tracking error of 3%. Our
strategy remains on par with the two baseline portfolios until around 2012, after which it steadily
outperforms them through to the end of the period. The empirical findings from both the factor-
specific long-short strategy and the portfolio construction via the Black-Litterman model provide
robust evidence of the potential to exploit factor cyclicality through regime analysis using the sparse
jump model with a readily accessible feature set.

From the figure, it is notable that the outperformance of an equally weighted factor portfolio
(benchmark) over the market steadily declined after about 2015, diminishing further following the
COVID-19 market shock, and nearly disappeared post-2022 as the Federal Reserve implemented
aggressive interest rate hikes. Many well-known style factors have struggled recently14 due to a
concentration of returns in a few of the largest companies in the U.S. equity market, amid a high-
interest-rate environment not seen in nearly two decades. These factors have only begun to recover

It is beyond the scope and intention of our study and model to predict whether a comeback in factor
investing is imminent.

5 Conclusion

Motivated by the cyclical behavior of factor returns, this article proposes a dynamic factor
allocation strategy through regime analysis based on each factor’s active performance, synthesizing
these factor-specific regime inferences using the Black-Litterman model. A key distinction between
factor regime analysis and factor timing strategies is that regime analysis does not aim to predict
when a regime shift will occur but rather to identify when it has occurred, allowing investors to
capitalize on changing risk-return dynamics, compared to a static benchmark allocation.

We employ the sparse jump model (SJM) as the regime identification model, which clusters
temporal features while imposing a penalty for each transition in the hidden state sequence and
assigns different weights to features based on their in-sample clustering effect. The input features
include return and risk measures calculated from historical factor active returns, as well as features
representing the general market environment. The regimes identified by the SJM demonstrate
improved robustness and accuracy compared to traditional regime-switching models.

Our empirical study focuses on a U.S. equity investment universe comprising seven long-only
indices representing the market and six style factors – value, size, momentum, quality, low volatility,
and growth. We construct a hypothetical single-factor long-short strategy to evaluate the quality
of the factor-specific regime inferences and tune hyperparameters based on its performance. This
strategy also closely mirrors the active weights in the Black-Litterman model when an active view
of a factor is applied. We achieve positive Sharpe ratios across all factors, with low correlations
among them, demonstrating the high accuracy of our regime inferences.

Finally, we apply the Black-Litterman model, using the equally weighted allocation as the
benchmark, to determine the optimal dynamic allocation derived from the factor-specific regime
inferences. Empirical results show that our dynamic allocation strategy outperforms a static ap-
proach, enhancing key metrics such as the information ratio and Sharpe ratio while reducing maxi-
mum drawdown. These findings underscore the effectiveness of leveraging regime-switching signals
to exploit factor cyclicality and improve factor allocation performance.

Going forward, the statistical jump model framework can be enhanced through alternative
approaches for measuring the (dis-)similarity between a given time period and the cluster centroid.
For example, advanced neural network structures such as variational auto-encoders (VAEs) have
proven beneficial in intraday trading by developing regime-aware execution systems (Sawhney,
2021). Moreover, Antulov-Fantulin et al. (2024) have proposed a JM-inspired recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based model for regime identification. Another promising extension is the use of
generative models to expand the training and validation datasets, which could help mitigate the
challenge of overfitting – a constant issue in the field of investment.

Details of the Black-Litterman Model

Most of the results can be found in He and Litterman (1999). We present them here as they
provide significant motivation for our method of constructing the factor-specific long-short strategy.
Consider N securities and K view portfolios, represented by p1, . . . , pK ∈ RN , assembled into

If the investor optimizes a quadratic mean-

model are given by:

wBL = wbmk + P Tλ,
(2)
where λ = δ−1 (cid:0)P ΣP T + Ω/τ (cid:1)−1 (v − P π). Here, δ is the risk aversion parameter, Σ ∈ RN ×N is
the covariance matrix estimate, and Ω ∈ RK×K and τ denote the uncertainty matrix and parameter
in the views and the prior, respectively. Ω is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements ω1, . . . , ωK.

Thus, the active weights P Tλ = (cid:80)

lios, weighted by the vector λ. Using the Schur complement, the explicit formula for each element

Since we aim to tune the hyperparameters for each factor individually, λjpj is a natural choice

over time and the impact of the other views, expressed in pT
−j , is minimal. We cap the estimated
expected active return at ±5% per annum to mitigate the impact of extreme values.
